## Introduction

Solar radiation prediction is essential for various applications, including solar energy systems, agriculture, and climate studies. This project uses a linear regression model to predict solar radiation based on meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a fictional dataset containing meteorological data, including:
- Date and time (`datetime`)
- Temperature (`temperature`)
- Humidity (`humidity`)
- Wind speed (`wind_speed`)
- Solar radiation (`solar_radiation`)

The dataset is provided in a CSV file named `solar_radiation_data.csv`.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-radiation-prediction.git
   cd solar-radiation-prediction
   ```

2. Ensure you have the dataset (`solar_radiation_data.csv`) in the project directory.

3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python solar_radiation_prediction.py
   ```

- `solar_radiation_data.csv`: The dataset file.
- `solar_radiation_prediction.py`: The main script for data processing, model building, and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Methodology

1. **Load the Data**: The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
2. **Explore the Data**: Basic exploration of the data is performed using functions like `head()`, `describe()`, and `info()`. Seaborn is used for data visualization.
3. **Preprocess the Data**: Handling missing values and selecting relevant features.
4. **Build and Train the Model**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a linear regression model is built and trained using Scikit-learn.
5. **Evaluate the Model**: The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score.
6. **Visualize the Results**: A scatter plot is created to visualize the actual vs predicted solar radiation values.

## Results

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values.
- **R² Score**: The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

Example results:
```
Mean Squared Error: 1540.67
R² Score: 0.86
```
